# EnhancedTello
Enhanced stabilisation and facial recognition features for the DJI Tello Drone.
Credit for basis of this project goes to tsyrenschikov see https://github.com/tsyrenschikov/easytello for his original project.
This project adds the Enhanced Features folder, containing code for video feed based stabilisation and facial recognition.
I have integrated both of these features into the main tello.py file and added options to enable or disable them.
